\intro

I've always thought that English spelling is weird. For example, the "gh" in "tough" makes a "f" sound, the "o" in "women" makes a "ih" sound, and the "chsi" in "fuchsia" makes a "sh" sound. By assembling these, we can rewrite "fish" as "ghochsi"! Anyway, here's a list of weird English spellings.

To use this, replace each sound in a word with a corresponding sequence from this list.
