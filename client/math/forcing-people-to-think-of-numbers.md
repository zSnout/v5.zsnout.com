The [first article about guessing numbers](/math/guessing-numbers-with-algebra/) was pretty cool, but there are also ways to have somebody select more than one number, and end up at one result that you've already predicted.

## Forcing 9

This method forces the number 9 on the audience.

1. Ask each person to think of a six-digit number. For our example, we'll use 173924.
2. Ask each person to shuffle the digits in their number randomly, and to remember the result. (329471)
3. Ask each person to take the difference between their larger number and their smaller one. (329471 - 173924 = 155547)
4. Ask each person to add the digits in their number together, and to keep doing that until they have a one-digit number. (1+5+5+5+4+7 = 27, 2+7 = 9)
5. Each member of the audience now has 9.

## Forcing 1089

This method forces the number 1089 on the audience.

1. Ask each person to think of a non-symmetrical three-digit number where the digits are decreasing. We'll use 932 as an example.
2. Ask each person to reverse the digits in their number. (239)
3. Ask each person to subtract their smaller number from the larger. (693)
4. Ask each person to reverse the new number. (396)
5. Ask each person to add the two numbers together. (693 + 396 = 1089)
